Example to implement an SQL attack
	If the email is xxx@gmail.com and you do not know the password
	
	Under Email, enter :
	                xxx@gmail.com' OR 1=1 --'
					
					This will force a true condition and comment out the remaining 
					part of the sql query.
					
	Explore many more ways to do so.
	
Note: Remember to Un-comment the table creation section, the first time you run it
